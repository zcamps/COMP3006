# COMP3006
# Project2


#This folder contains everything for the Comp 3006 project 2. 
#It is important thsat in the file test_count, you uncomment all of the 
#file I/O statements first and execute the code once. 
#This will cause the tests to fail. 
#Then commenting these sections again and running the code will lead to 
#successful tests. The statements are there simply to create the tests files
#GitHub will not aloow users to upload blank files which are necessary for our tests
#So we need to create them first before being able to runt he code
